# Workshop 1 : PYTHON FUNDAMENTALS

We cover the fundamentals of Python in the Juptyer Notebooks environment.  In this workshop we explore Python 3.6.1 and the basic concepts of the language including variables, loops, data types and functions.  We will do hands on explorations within Jupyter Notebooks so that the concepts are more easily understood.

## Prerequisites
* verified installation of Python 3.6.1
* verified installation of Anaconda 4.3.1

## Objectives

* Understand and use the basic operations of the Jupyter Notebook environment
* Understand basic Python language constructs such as:
    * variables (names)
    * loops
    * data types (int, float, strings, lists, etc.)
    * functions
* Write basic Python programs with the core constructs using Jupyter
* Understand and use the basic operations of the Jupyter Notebook environment
* (optional) Gain exposure to git and Github

## Resources

* [Installing Python and Anaconda](./ws0/)
* Python 3 official [documentation and reference site](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* Jupyter Notebooks official [documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Python `csv` library [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

## Workshop Notebook
All content in these notebooks are best viewed in the NBViewer at Juptyer.org.  You may, of course, view these files on Github, but you will lose some functionality by just viewing the materials in Github.

* [GO HERE](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NCAR/SOARS2017_DataWorkshops/tree/master/A/ws1/ws01a_overview.ipynb) to see the Notebook as it was intended to be viewed in the NBViewer!  

# Workshop 2 : DATA WRANGLING IN PYTHON

## Prerequisites
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) library installed with Anaconda
* Basic understanding of Python lists, dictionaries and sets
* Some understanding of matrices
* Jupyter Notebooks
* some data files in CSV and Excel format

## Objectives

* Understand the basic concepts in Pandas for importing data
* Understand basic Pandas Series and Dataframe constructs 
* Write basic Python programs with Pandas in Jupyter, using functions for summarizing, manipulating and exporting (saving) data
* Build a basic plot of data using Pandas plotting functions

## Resources

* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (Python Data Analysis Library)
* [Pandas Cheat Sheet at DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/python-pandas-cheat-sheet#gs.Umh8xyc) (as [pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/PandasPythonForDataScience.pdf))

# Workshop 3: HANDS ON REAL WORLD DATA ANALYSIS

## Prerequisites
* installation of [MetPy](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy)

## Objectives

* Get hands on experience with real world data
* work through a hands on analysis of data using MetPy

## Resources
