> By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest. ~Confucius


| Workshop Segment | Purpose |
|:----------------:|:--------|
| [Command line or Python? Which should you use for data acquisition?]() | There are some interesting advantages of using command line scripting versus Python.  On the other hand, Python can be a powerful way to generalize a reuseable solution.]
| [Exploring NASA EOS DISC Data]() |We'll look at how to automate data extraction with Python from a system known to be a bit challenging for beginners. |
| [Algorithmically finding overlapping time sequences: a collaborative approach](./contrib) | How do we find a data structure and algorithm that facilitates finding time sequences that overlap? |
